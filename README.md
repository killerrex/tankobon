# tankobon
Small utility to organize and rename series volume and chapters.

## Task
Rename a group of directories with subdirectories. Tankobon searchs for numbers in the folder names and tries to structure them in a "volume N/chapter M" scheme.
It also tries to take into account that a volume/chapter can contain also some spurious numbers like the volume number in the chapters name.

## Future
- Organise also the pages
- Improve the spurious numbers recognition
- Create a GUI
